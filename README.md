# Tracking quantum experiments with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs and Amazon SageMaker Experiments

This repo demonstrates how you can track and manage your hybrid quantum-classical experiments using the Hybrid Jobs feature of Amazon Braket and Amazon SageMaker Experiments, a feature used by machine learning developers on AWS to organize their experiments and trials.

## Getting started

Open `iris-quantum-experiment-tracking.ipynb` and follow the section `Step 1: Setting up the environment for experiment tracking` to set up your environment. Then clone the repository in the Braket Notebook instance created in this step, open the Notebook `iris-quantum-experiment-tracking.ipynb` with the `conda_braket` kernel, and start running the cells.
